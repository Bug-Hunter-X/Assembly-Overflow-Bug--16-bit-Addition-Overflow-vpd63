```assembly
mov ax, 0x1234
add ax, bx
; ... some more instructions ...
mov cx, ax
```
This code snippet has a potential bug if the value of `bx` is large enough to cause an overflow when added to `ax`.  If `ax` + `bx` exceeds 0xFFFF (the maximum value for a 16-bit register), an overflow will occur, resulting in an incorrect value in `cx`.  The overflow will wrap around, leading to unexpected behavior.
