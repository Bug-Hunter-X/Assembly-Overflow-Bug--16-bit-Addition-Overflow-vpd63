```assembly
mov ax, 0x1234
add ax, bx
jnc no_overflow ; Jump if no carry (no overflow)
; Overflow occurred, handle it appropriately
; Example: Set an error flag or take other corrective actions
mov dx, 1 ; Set an error flag
no_overflow:
mov cx, ax
```
This improved version checks for a carry flag after the addition.  The `jnc` (jump if no carry) instruction prevents the program from continuing if an overflow occurs. Appropriate error handling is then added. Note that this is a very simple example of overflow handling.  More robust error handling might be required depending on the context of your application.
